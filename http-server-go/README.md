# Learn HTTP Servers in Go

In a way, this course is where _everything_ you've learned so far on the Boot.dev back-end track comes together. Building HTTP servers is the bread-and-butter of a backend developer's day-to-day work.

This course assumes you already have a solid understanding of Go. If you don't, take a step back and take our [Go course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang).

## Goals of This Course

- Understand what web servers are and how they power real-world web applications
- Build a production-style HTTP server in Go, without the use of a framework
- Use JSON, headers, and status codes to communicate with clients via a RESTful API
- Learn what makes Go a great language for building fast web servers
- Use type safe SQL to store and retrieve data from a Postgres database
- Implement a secure authentication/authorization system with well-tested cryptography libraries
- Build and understand webhooks and API keys
- Document the REST API with markdown
