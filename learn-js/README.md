# Learn JavaScript (for Developers)

This course assumes you're already familiar with programming fundamentals in at least one other language. I'll move quickly through the basics. For example, I'll explain *how functions in JavaScript* work, but I'll assume you already know *what a function is*.

*If you're brand new to coding I recommend starting with our [Python for beginners course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-code-python) first.*

## What to Expect

For most of this course you'll be writing code in your browser, but we will occasionally drop down to your local machine and use our [official CLI tool](https://github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev) to pass off lessons.

We'll be building parts of a make-believe software project: **Textio**! A [SaaS](https://www.salesforce.com/saas/) app for sending SMS (text messages) to customers.
